dbudget
=======

dbudget is an accounting and budget application which follows the KISS rule:

* No fancy sluggish GUI forcing you to remember 42 keyboard shortcuts and click
  mouse buttons 17 times anyway just to enter a single transaction.
* No XML, no JSON, no databases. All transactions and reports are defined in a
  human-readable plain text file. Enter your data in your favourite editor
  and, if you wish, keep them in a revision control system of your choice.
* Even a text-only terminal may be used to print a quite elegant and readable
  report. Future versions will include also HTML, LaTeX and PDF report
  generators. And even now it's just a few keystrokes from plotting fancy
  graphs with gnuplot.
